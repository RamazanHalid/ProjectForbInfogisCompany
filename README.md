Hi, I am Ramazan Halid. I prepare a mobile application for b-infoGIS company. This app has splash screen, login screen, registration screen and home screen.
For Authitication I used a restful API (written with C# and .NET). You can look to this back-end with this link https://github.com/RamazanHalid/BasicBackendTemplate

Here is some Screen Shots from the mobile application.

SplashScreen: Running for 4.5 seconds.

 Login Screen: Here users can login their account. If an user do not have any account, the user can register with click 'Create new account'.
 Here there are some validation when we logining. These are: fields can not be empty, first field must be E-Mail format. Authitication information checked by back-end.

All events that happen during user operations are done in the back-end. For example, an error from entering the wrong e-mail address.
